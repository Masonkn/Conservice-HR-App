App to manage employees
@Author Mason Nielson

To add records to the database simply type information into the datagrid and press submit.

Known bugs:
The server breaks the application when a record is added to the data which contains nulls in the field LastName, FirstName, and Address.
**There must be data in LastName, FirstName, and Address when submitting a record.
As of now the Recruiting page simply counts which Employees have an EndDate. And does not work with the current date. The check box in the terminated column does not create an EndDate field.
Please do not press submit while there is text in the search box. It will not work right.
